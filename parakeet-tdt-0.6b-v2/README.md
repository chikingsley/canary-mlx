Our AI models are designed and/or optimized to run on NVIDIA GPU-accelerated systems. By leveraging NVIDIA's hardware (e.g. GPU cores) and software frameworks (e.g., CUDA libraries), the model achieves faster training and inference times compared to CPU-only solutions. 

## <span style="color:#466f00;">How to Use this Model:</span>

To train, fine-tune or play with the model you will need to install [NVIDIA NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo). We recommend you install it after you've installed latest PyTorch version.
```bash
pip install -U nemo_toolkit["asr"]
``` 
The model is available for use in the NeMo toolkit [3], and can be used as a pre-trained checkpoint for inference or for fine-tuning on another dataset.

#### Automatically instantiate the model

```python
import nemo.collections.asr as nemo_asr
asr_model = nemo_asr.models.ASRModel.from_pretrained(model_name="nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2")
```

#### Transcribing using Python
First, let's get a sample
```bash
wget https://dldata-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2086-149220-0033.wav
```
Then simply do:
```python
output = asr_model.transcribe(['2086-149220-0033.wav'])
print(output[0].text)
```

#### Transcribing with timestamps

To transcribe with timestamps:
```python
output = asr_model.transcribe(['2086-149220-0033.wav'], timestamps=True)
# by default, timestamps are enabled for char, word and segment level
word_timestamps = output[0].timestamp['word'] # word level timestamps for first sample
segment_timestamps = output[0].timestamp['segment'] # segment level timestamps
char_timestamps = output[0].timestamp['char'] # char level timestamps

for stamp in segment_timestamps:
    print(f"{stamp['start']}s - {stamp['end']}s : {stamp['segment']}")
```


## <span style="color:#466f00;">Software Integration:</span>

**Runtime Engine(s):**
* NeMo 2.2  


**Supported Hardware Microarchitecture Compatibility:** 
* NVIDIA Ampere
* NVIDIA Blackwell  
* NVIDIA Hopper
* NVIDIA Volta

**[Preferred/Supported] Operating System(s):**

## <span style="color:#466f00;">Training and Evaluation Datasets:</span>

### <span style="color:#466f00;">Training</span>

This model was trained using the NeMo toolkit [3], following the strategies below:

- Initialized from a FastConformer SSL checkpoint that was pretrained with a wav2vec method on the LibriLight dataset[7].  
- Trained for 150,000 steps on 64 A100 GPUs. 
- Dataset corpora were balanced using a temperature sampling value of 0.5.  
- Stage 2 fine-tuning was performed for 2,500 steps on 4 A100 GPUs using approximately 500 hours of high-quality, human-transcribed data of NeMo ASR Set 3.0.  

Training was conducted using this [example script](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/main/examples/asr/asr_transducer/speech_to_text_rnnt_bpe.py) and [TDT configuration](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/main/examples/asr/conf/fastconformer/hybrid_transducer_ctc/fastconformer_hybrid_tdt_ctc_bpe.yaml).

The tokenizer was constructed from the training set transcripts using this [script](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/main/scripts/tokenizers/process_asr_text_tokenizer.py).

### <span style="color:#466f00;">Training Dataset</span>
The model was trained on the Granary dataset[8], consisting of approximately 120,000 hours of English speech data:

- 10,000 hours from human-transcribed NeMo ASR Set 3.0, including:
  - LibriSpeech (960 hours)
  - Fisher Corpus
  - National Speech Corpus Part 1 
  - VCTK
  - VoxPopuli (English)
  - Europarl-ASR (English)
  - Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS English) – 2,000-hour subset
  - Mozilla Common Voice (v7.0)
  - AMI

- 110,000 hours of pseudo-labeled data from:
  - YTC (YouTube-Commons) dataset[4]
  - YODAS dataset [5]
  - Librilight [7]

All transcriptions preserve punctuation and capitalization. The Granary dataset[8] will be made publicly available after presentation at Interspeech 2025.

## <span style="color:#466f00;">Performance</span>

#### Huggingface Open-ASR-Leaderboard Performance
The performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models is measured using Word Error Rate (WER). Given that this model is trained on a large and diverse dataset spanning multiple domains, it is generally more robust and accurate across various types of audio.
